	<h2>What is the home like?</h2>
		<p>
From big rooms to small rooms, shared rooms to private rooms as well as multiple bathrooms we have everything to make your loved ones feel at home. The backyard has a covered patio to keep the sun at bay and the rain off your skin. There is also a path that wraps around the side of the house for walking exercise. For those more inclined to stay indoors we have activities as well as television, on-demand and multiple streaming options available.
